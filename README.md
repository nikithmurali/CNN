## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nikithmurali/CNN.git
    ```
2. Unzip the cloned repository:
    ```bash
    unzip CNN-main.zip
    ```
3. Import the Jupyter Notebook into Google Colab:
    - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
    - Click on `File` > `Upload notebook`.
    - Upload the `CNN_Plant_Disease_Recognition.ipynb` file from the unzipped directory.
    - Upload the train and test file `train and test.zip` [recommend uploading them to your google drive] or directly to colab

## Usage

Once you have imported the notebook into Google Colab, you can run the cells to train and evaluate the CNN model for plant disease recognition. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to understand the process and use the model.
